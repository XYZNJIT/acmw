    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        We strive to create an environment that celebrates diversity and cultivates the growth and success of women in computing. 
        By organizing various events, projects, and initiatives, we aim to inspire, educate, and provide a platform for women to 
        thrive in the tech industry.
    </p>
    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to promote and support women at NJIT, specifically female undergraduate and graduate students, 
        who are pursuing careers in computing and related fields. We aim to encourage and empower these women to excel 
        in their computing education and seize professional opportunities. Moreover, we strive to create a supportive and 
        inclusive community that fosters networking, mentorship, and collaboration among women in computing. By advocating 
        for equal representation and opportunities, we aim to eliminate gender disparities and ensure that women have equal 
        access to and representation in the field of computing. Through these initiatives, we are dedicated to empowering women,
        creating a more diverse and inclusive tech industry, and driving positive change in the computing community at NJIT.
